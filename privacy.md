Grokiphile – Privacy Policy

Grokiphile does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal information or browsing data.
The extension operates entirely on your device and does not communicate with external servers.

The only data stored is a single user preference that controls whether the extension automatically redirects to Grokipedia or shows a manual option. This preference is stored locally using Chrome’s built-in extension storage and never leaves your device.

Grokiphile does not track user activity, does not log visited pages, does not use analytics, and does not access or modify any data beyond detecting the current Wikipedia article title for the purpose of generating the equivalent Grokipedia link.

If you have any questions, you may contact the developer at pranjal19@pm.me.
